# Portfolio_Analysis_single_assets
This is a simple single stock price analysis over a time period

I have manually rendered prices of Lincoln Pharma Stock price over 12 months from 21 Aug 2019 to 22 Aug 2020 (today).
Then I have analysed its continuous compounding rate of return aka log return instead of simple return.
Variance and St Dev analysis clears a lot of air after doing this.
